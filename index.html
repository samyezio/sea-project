            <h2>Beauty of Water</h2>
            <p>water makes the world beautiful.Seas,rivers,cascades and many more.without water all shapes of lives would be vanished.
                all we can say is water is life.Water plays a vital role in one’s life. It is required not just for our own survival but also for the proper functioning of our planet. All fruits and vegetables contain abundant water in them. To stay healthy, it is needed to have plenty of water, i.e., approximately 3–4 litres of water per day. The human body needs water, and a lack of it can result in major health problems. Kidney stones are a serious health problem caused by insufficient water consumption. Water has the ability to heal and is necessary for life to exist. Our planet is the only place where life is conceivable since water and all of the other essential elements for life are present. Planets, such as Mars, Mercury, and Venus, are uninhabitable. They resemble a desolate desert since there is no water. Water is necessary for life, and it also helps to keep the environment clean. </p>
